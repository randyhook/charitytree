charitytree
===========

An intuitive web app for managing a charity tree program.

A charity tree program is typically set up as follows:
1. Clients apply for assistance, specifying what they and their family members would wish to receive.
2. Donors apply to the program, specifying how much they are willing to give.
3. The charity organization gives out anonymous wish item tags to the donor organizations.
4. The donor organizations typically place these tags on a Christmas tree, and individuals choose
tags that will suggest the shopping item to obtain.
5. The donor organization delivers the gifts to the charity organziation.
6. The charity organization gets the gifts to the clients.

I wrote several articles on my [blog](http://randallhook.com/2011/01/03/launching-the-charity-tree-project/) when I first began exploring the idea.
